/*
 * @class LatLngBounds
 * @aka L.LatLngBounds
 *
 * Represents a rectangular geographical area on a map.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```js
 * var southWest = L.latLng(40.712, -74.227),
 * northEast = L.latLng(40.774, -74.125),
 * bounds = L.latLngBounds(southWest, northEast);
 * ```
 *
 * All Leaflet methods that accept LatLngBounds objects also accept them in a simple Array form (unless noted otherwise), so the bounds example above can be passed like this:
 *
 * ```js
 * map.fitBounds([
 * 	[40.712, -74.227],
 * 	[40.774, -74.125]
 * ]);
 * ```
